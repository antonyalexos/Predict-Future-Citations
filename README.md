#Predict-Future-Citations

This is a very simple project in which we try to predict future citations based only in the citations that the paper has in the past years. 
It is a Time Series problem and a semester project for the course [C418 Neuro-Fuzzy Computating](https://courses.e-ce.uth.gr/CE418/).
The description of the problem and the report are in Greek but you can easily translate it with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).
